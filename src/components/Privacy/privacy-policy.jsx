            # BeautyMatch Privacy Policy

            **Effective Date:** 2025-07-28

            ## 1. Introduction
            I, **Soumyodeep Dey**, am the solo developer of the BeautyMatch Chrome Extension ("Extension"). I respect your privacy and want you to understand how your data is handled.

            ## 2. What Data Is Used
            BeautyMatch uses the following information:

            - **Skin profile inputs**: You may enter your skin tone, skin type, and known allergies.
            - **Product page content**: The extension temporarily reads the ingredients listed on supported websites (such as Nykaa, Amazon.in, and Sephora) to determine if a product matches your profile.

            ✅ **No personally identifiable information (PII)** is collected, stored, or transmitted.

            ## 3. How the Data Is Handled
            - All data remains **on your device**.
            - Your skin profile is stored **locally** in your browser using Chrome's `storage.sync` API, which may optionally sync across devices via your Google account (depending on your Chrome settings).
            - Product ingredients are processed **in real time** and are **not saved** after generating the verdict.
            - The extension has **no backend server**, **no external database**, and does **not send or receive** any data over the internet.

            ## 4. Data Sharing
            BeautyMatch does **not share**, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties or external services.

            ## 5. Your Control
            You have full control over your data:
            - You can view or update your profile at any time through the onboarding screen.
            - You can clear your profile data by removing the extension or resetting its storage via Chrome settings.

            ## 6. No Cookies or Tracking
            BeautyMatch uses **no cookies**, **no tracking scripts**, **no analytics**, and **no advertising**.

            ## 7. Changes to This Policy
            If this privacy policy changes in the future (for example, if new features are added that affect data handling), this document will be updated with a new effective date.

            ## 8. Contact
            If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please contact me at:
            📧 **soumyodeepdey2003@gmail.com**

            ## 9. Conclusion
            Your privacy is my priority. This extension is built to run fully on your device with your data staying private. This policy is meant to be transparent and easy to understand so you know exactly how your information is handled.

            Thank you for using **BeautyMatch**!
